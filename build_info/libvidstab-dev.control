Description: video stabilization library (development files)
 Imagine you captured a nice video with your camcorder, compact camera or
 even cell phone while skiing, cycling or whatever sports and the video is
 basically just jiggled.
 .
 Modern cameras come along with hardware stabilisation, however this does
 not work if you have really strong vibrations - rather the contrary -
 sometimes this mechanism starts to oscillate.
 .
 Vid.Stab is your friend in this matter. It is designed to stabilize even
 strongly jiggled clips.
 .
 This package contains the development files of vid.stab.
